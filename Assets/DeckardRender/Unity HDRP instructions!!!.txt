If you are planing to use Deckard with 2019.1 Unity version of HDRP you have to follow 
this instructions: 
-Important: Don't install DeckardPPS_HDRP_2018 package!! This is only to be used with Unity 2018 and PPS v2!!
-Add a Deckard component to your camera as usual.
-Deckard will prompt to Switch camera to Deferred HDR rendering. Instead click on "Don't switch, I'm using HDRP" button. 
-In Unity go to Main Menu/Window/Deckard View. This will open a new preview window for Deckard and it will have a same resolution as your Game View, but there you can preview what Deckard renders. 
-Use Deckard and have some fun. 


Known Issues: 
-Unity HDRP supports only one single directional light. Due to this limitation, you shouldn't use Deckard Ambient Outdoor light in
combination with another directional Light. 
-Some combinations of Unity and HDRP can produce a memory leak when a directional light gets moved while in play mode. This bug affects Unity, 
and having it with Deckard will eat all available memory much sooner - producing a system crash.
If you experience this issue, be sure not to use Dekcard Soft Light on diurectional lights, and be sure not to move Directional lights.Best way would be to
try different combinations of Unity and HDRP and see what version doesn't produce this bug. 
-Unity HDRP raytrace works with Deckard, but with some limitaions - Raytracing requires much VRAM, and you might not be able to render 
at larger resolutions with Deckard. 720p is known to work well on RTX2080 that has only 8GB of VRAM. RTX2080TI with 11gb of memory (or better) is recomended
when using raytrace. 

p.s. At this moment some Deckard post processing features are unavailable with HDRP. You can compensate for those features by Using built in HDRP image effects. 
p.s.s. Deckard Demo scenes doesn't work with HDRP.
